### Highlight of the Project 

1. This project was created with the help of HTML, Css & React JS.
2. For smooth scrolling I have used (react-infinite-scroll-component) package from npm.
3. For api binding I have used axios package.
4. For UI as you have mentioned not to use any libraries so I have not used it, but with the help of normal Css I have made Movie List App UI.
5. From bonus section part I have Implemented a search bar which searches for the movie based on the search string.

### How to run Project 
1. Firstly the link which I have shared of my github account take a clone of it.
2. As the cloning part of the project is done then do "npm i" which will install all the required package to run the project.
3. So as the "npm i" is done after that switch to "master" branch.
4. For switching the branch the command is "git checkout -b master".
5. As switching is done then we are in the master branch so after that we can do "npm start" to run the project.
6. Hurray!!! you have done it now you run the project easily.
